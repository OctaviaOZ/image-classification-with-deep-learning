You work for the IT department of CarsUnlimited, a car rental and leasing company, providing travelers and car enthusiasts the best experience when searching for cars to drive. You would like to build an application that would let the enthusiast snap a picture of any car on the road and provide information about the cars available at CarsUnlimited. You have a wonderful mobile application team that could build the functionality to build the UI but not the feature to identify cars and their models from any given picture. Owing to the challenges in lighting, orientation and scale of the photograph, you decide to use machine learning to solve this problem. You embark on a journey to learn how to build such a system using machine learning.
